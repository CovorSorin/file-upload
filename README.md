# File-Transfer
Simple python file transfer via server

If you want to play around with the code, clone the code or
just download it.

Open a terminal and run "python server.py".
In another terminal run "python clinent.py".

To use your actual IP (not the localhost) as the server 
it needs to have the port from the script forwarded.
