# File-Transfer
Simple python file transfer via server

If you want to play around with the code, clone the code or just download it.</br>

Open a terminal and run "python server.py".</br>
In another terminal run "python clinent.py".</br>

To use your actual IP (not the localhost) as the server</br>
it needs to have the port from the script forwarded.</br>
